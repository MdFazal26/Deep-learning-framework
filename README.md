# Deep-learning-framework
Machine learning techniques are being widely used to develop an intrusion detection 
system (IDS) for detecting and classifying cyber-attacks at the network-level and 
host-level in a timely and automatic manner. However, many challenges arise since 
malicious attacks are continuously changing and are occurring in very large volumes 
requiring a scalable solution. There are different malware datasets available publicly 
for further research by cyber security community. However, no existing study has 
shown the detailed analysis of the performance of various machine learning 
algorithms on various publicly available datasets. Due to the dynamic nature of 
malware with continuously changing attacking methods, the malware datasets 
available publicly are to be updated systematically and benchmarked. 
This work, deep neural network (DNN), a type of deep learning model is 
explored to develop a flexible and effective IDS to detect and classify unforeseen and 
unpredictable cyber-attacks. The continuous change in network behaviour and rapid 
evolution of attacks makes it necessary to evaluate various datasets which are 
generated over the years through static and dynamic approaches. This type of study 
facilitates to identify the best algorithm which can effectively work in detecting future 
cyber-attacks.
